so if for last 4 hours there is now new stuff at metacpan/feed/recent it should fail?
22:51   aleksei there is no I meant
22:52   oalders yeah, we need to know if the indexer has stopped adding new releases
22:54   aleksei so, we do not tell here indexer failures from authors stop upload new distros? :) which is probably always not  
22:55   oalders well, the uploads are to PAUSE, so that's a different failure point entirely
22:55   oalders there's rarely an upload problem with PAUSE
22:56   aleksei ok, so in other words if latest item at the top of items list should have date younger than 4 hour ago, right?
22:57   aleksei not latest, first one, at the top , of course 
22:57   oalders correct
22:57   oalders well, latest will be at the top
22:58   aleksei sure
23:02   aleksei I guess it is doable but I need to think how this type of checks could be expressed in swat way, as it tends to be more declarative rather than imperative  
23:02   oalders right
23:02   aleksei but it is interesting case for swat, anyway ... 
23:02   oalders if it's not doable, that's ok, but it's an important thing for us to measure
23:05   aleksei ok, at least strait forward approach, which fit swat is to compare `dates` against `now - 4hours` regexp, which though quite approximate ... 
23:06   aleksei by dates I mean <dc:date> in <item> element
